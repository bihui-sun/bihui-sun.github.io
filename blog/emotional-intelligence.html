          EQ
          <p>
            Your EQ measures your emotional intelligence, assessing your ability
            to identify, manage, and express your emotions. Your emotional
            intelligence skills — like self-awareness, empathy, and
            self-motivation— help you name your feelings and consequent behavior
            to then recognize it more easily in others.
          </p>
          <ul class="item-eq-blog">
            <li>
              Information processing: EQ can help you perceive and understand
              your and others' emotions based on information like verbal and
              nonverbal cues.
            </li>
            <li>
              Interpersonal skills versus job performance: A good EQ means you
              can empathize with others and control your reactions,
              significantly influencing your ability to create rewarding
              relationships.
            </li>
            <li>
              Internal versus external knowledge: Increasing your EQ involves
              immense self-awareness to identify your emotions and their
              subsequent behaviors.
            </li>
            <li>
              Conflict resolution: When facing conflict, EQ helps you understand
              the other person's perspective and control emotional responses.
            </li>

        <div class="iq-container">
          IQ
          <p>
            Your IQ measures your capacity to learn, comprehend, and apply
            knowledge to daily tasks. This involves several skills, like logic
            and verbal communication. And developing your IQ involves learning
            how to filter out irrelevant information, retain important details,
            and solve complex issues.
          </p>
          <ul class="item-eq-blog">
            <li>
              Information processing: IQ can help you to learn, interpret, and
              process information to develop hard and soft skills.
            </li>
            <li>
              Interpersonal skills versus job performance: A good IQ makes you a
              competent and efficient worker with a robust skill set.
            </li>
            <li>
              Internal versus external knowledge: Increasing your IQ means
              acquiring tangible knowledge and practicing concrete skills like
              solving logic puzzles and performing well on verbal exams.
            </li>
            <li>
              Conflict resolution: When facing conflict, determines how
              logically and efficiently you can solve the issue at hand.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Neither EQ nor IQ are inherently better. Good emotional intelligence
        helps you navigate social and emotional situations well, while good
        intellectual intelligence sets you up with the cognitive tools to
        understand and overcome challenges in your daily routine.
