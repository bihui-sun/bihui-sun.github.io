        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the core learning?
      </p>
      <p>
        -I think the first thing must be I thought I would feel programming
        really difficult for me once I tried it but it turned out to be not so
        bad. The second thing would be I didn't know I could sit at the desk and
        on my laptop for more than 8 hours every day. The third thing is I need
        to integrate this neuroplasticity and growth mindset into my learning
        process. When I got frustrated because of the challenging task I would
        tell myself I feel miserable because I am learning something new. It's
        part of it.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </p>
      <p>
        -I think these will help us understanding and anticipating the needs,
        preferences, and frustrations of the end-users.  They will also help us
        understand, identify, manage and strategically utilise Emotions of
        myself and others.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</p>
      <p>
        -The important concept like emotional intelligence, neuroplasticity and
        growth mindset are useful for my learning journey. Also, I have been
        practicing fully listening to others in formal and informal
        circumstances.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</p>
      <p>
        -I think the challenging part would be putting everything into practice.
        It's always hard, not only for core learning, for all the tech or skills
        we have learned during foundation. It's easy for us to learn from the
        book, online or even from the tutor. But how you are going to integrate
        things into practice and how to use this in our daily life is the most
        challenging part. It requires lots of practice deliberately.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </p>
      <p>
        -Because we all need to finish the bootcamp course within 17 weeks,
        that's a lot to learn in such a short time. We need to learn these core
        concept to make sure we are looking after ourselves and our wellbeing.
        Also, core learning is teaching us important human skills that we will
        need at future work place. That requires working with others and
        communicate with others.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        -Not really. It helped me relax and have a short break from my code. I
        normally see the core section or reflection as a break or run away from
        what I got stuck on. It worked for me and I got the chance to distract
        myself and my brain can rest a bit before I get back to the problem I
        had.
