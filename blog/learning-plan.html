      <p>1. What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</p>
      <p>
        I hope I can use the skills I gain during this course to land a job
        after my graduation. Then build up my skill levels through my job. But
        in the long run, I am not aiming for becoming super or one of the best
        in terms of tech. I'm more hoping I can have fun and explore the
        possiblities help female business owners to support their business no
        matter it's the tech side or the marketing side.
      </p>

      <p>
        2. What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp?
      </p>
      <p>
        My biggest strength is once I set up a goal I will achieve it, whatever
        it takes. But that is one of my biggest limitations because I put a lot
        of pressure on myself and don't really ease my tense until I achieve my
        goal. During bootcamp, I will need to keep reminding myself not to be so
        harsh on myself and keep that neuroplasiticity and growth mindset in
        mind.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        3. What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
        will be?
      </p>
      <p>
        The biggest non-tech challenge for me probably is how to do socializing
        or networking I guess. I am not a people person at all and don't enjoy
        being part of the big group, chatting or things like that. I'm most of
        the time socially awkward and don't feel comfortable and relaxed when
        surrounded by a large group.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        4. What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </p>
      <p>
        Networking skills. It's hard for me to do networking especially in large
        event. I tend to just hide at the corner or only talk to the people I
        know. For me, most of the time, one on one is okay but if under any
        circumstances more than 4 people, I will feel uncomfortable talking to
        the persons I don't know well. Just simply can't find the topic to start
        or the topic will end after 2-3 sentences.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>5. What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</p>
      <p>
        Teach me knowledge that's currently used widely in this industry. Guide
        me and make sure I'm on the right track on both tech side and human
        skill side and give me feedbacks along my learning journey.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>6. What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</p>
      <p>
        My plan would be finishing mos of the workload during weekdays and try
        to show up1-2 days at the campus to comminicate and ask questions. Also,
        always respect different opinions and different voices and always find
        something to learn from others. Implement fully listening when others
        are talking and have the courage to stand up to give feedback to those
        who always interrupt me when I'm talking.

      <p>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p>
      <p>
        My short-term goal would be luckily find a starting job in the industry
        after my graduation. Long-term goal would be getting good at tech and
        human skills to be able to work in a different country or remotely and
        help local female small business owners build up their website to better
        help them start/build up their businesses.

        2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </p>
      <p>
        -Achiever (but sometimes work too hard and not looking after myself);<br />
        -Easy to work with (sometimes value other people's opinions over my own
        and won't stick to my own opinion);<br />
        -A good listener (most of the time not willing to express enough about
        myself);
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </p>
      <p>
        -Communication skills: I don't quite enjoy socializing with others and I
        need to build up my social skills;<br />
        -Networking skills: I am a good listener and it also means I don't talk
        a lot about myself;<br />
        -Confidence: I always got compared to my peers when I was little so most
        of the time I am not confident enough even when I am capable of doing
        it.
      </p>

        4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include:
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of how I will manage the workload, I make daily plans based on
        the content of every sprint. I adjust my study time based on how fast
        and slow I study every day. Also, I will make sure I communicate with
        other learners to make sure we are on the same page and how where we are
        heading, and talk to my facilitator if needed. And if things are
        building up, what I need to do is take a deep breath, sit down, and
        think about what’s gonna be the next step to sort this problem out. Then
        solve another problem based on the sequence it should be. Or just ask
        for help.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
      </p>
      <p>
        -How: ask the internet/my friends who are in the industry
        already/facilitators;<br />
        -Where: I think I will google it first, see if I can figure it out
        myself. If I can't I will seek help from facilitators on Discord. If
        during weekends, I probably will just call a friend out to help me solve
        the problem.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</p>
      <p>
        -Support me, encourage me, trust me, and respect me;<br />
        -Help me build up my tech skills as well as the ability to solve
        problems by myself.<br />
        -Help me build up my human skills and networking skills which probably
        will contribute to my later job-seeking stage.<br />
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </p>
      <p>
        My time is quite flexible since I don't have any family members here but
        I do need some time out when my brain refuses to work. But I can adjust
        that in my own time.
