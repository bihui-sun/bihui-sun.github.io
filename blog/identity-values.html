      <h1>Identity and Values</h1>
      <p>
        你好! Hello! I'm Bihui I am originally from China and 碧徽 is my name in
        Chinese characters. My background is a bit of mixed. I studied botany
        and did some research on plant physiology in a lab for 3 years then
        joined a Dutch company as a marketing assistant regarding Sino-Dutch
        business. After that, I arrived in New Zealand and then became a teacher
        here for more than 4 years.

        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, as a Chinese, I feel it's hard to have an internal conversation
        with myself and know what I really want for life or a career because my
        life was sort of planned before 18. You go to school like everybody does
        and go to uni after the National College Entrance Examination which you
        need to work extremely hard on because that's practically the only way
        to get a 'decent' job, with a pretty 'decent' degree. I was living
        within the expectations of my parents and the society but no one asked
        me what I really want to do, including myself. I think this, to most
        extent, explains why I am living here in New Zealand, away from my
        family, my childhood friends, and all the stuff that I'm familiar with
        being around. And it feels good when you start to think for yourself and
        talk to yourself, to try different things and see if you like it or not.
        It's the process that helps me know where I am heading, even if I change
        my destination on my way there. This will be my answer to the first
        question and what I have learned through this journey is always put
        yourself first and listen to yourself. I would still make the same
        decision if I had a start-over.

        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I arrived here, I soon found even little kids are encouraged to do
        the things they like and most of them know what they are interested in.
        I guess that's because of the cultural difference between the two
        countries. We prefer to follow the crowd and are scared of being left
        behind. That's why I didn't even think about what I value as an
        individual because I never got offered another option but to do a lot of
        studying and then get my head too overwhelmed to think about if I really
        want it or like it. I am lucky enough to have a friend who helped me
        walk on a different path and encourages me a lot and cares about my
        opinion as an individual. It's not only the feeling of being respected
        but also the feeling that my opinion matters. In the later days, I
        learned from her to stand up for myself when I got treated unfairly at
        the workplace and speak up for myself when needed. I guess that is what
        I value at the moment, my own thoughts and ideas, respecting others as
        individuals and enjoy harmony with personal boundaries.

        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of my strength, I would like to say I am an achiever and I work
        hard and possess a great deal of stamina. I take immense satisfaction in
        being busy and productive. I can use my mental and physical energy for
        hours when the situation demands such effort. Also, I generally
        persevere and push myself to keep working on assignments until I finish
        them. Most of the time I am quite stubborn to refuse to quit until I
        reach my goal. The downside of it could be I am giving pressure to
        others as I am expecting others to be the same as me. And sometimes, I
        may focus too much on the process and rush to solve every problem not
        the people. By nature, I love being caring and kind. In most cases, I
        can sense it when a person requires my assistance. I enjoy initiating
        conversations with timid individuals who struggle to express their
        thoughts or feelings. I sometimes will respond to people even before
        they state their needs. I always try to find the uniqueness in each
        individual. But sometimes, I observe too much and share too little and
        assume they instinctively know my likes, dislikes, or needs. I am a
        trustworthy person and enjoy team work with my colleagues. I value
        everyone working together as a team and always put the group first and
        think my opinion doesn't matter.

        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.

        When I was a teacher, we had different cultural day celebration
        activities happening sometimes during weekends and sometimes straight
        after work. Some teachers were not very happy because it was their own
        time but every cultural day celebration only happens once a year and
        after the activity, kids will be happy and parents are happy which kind
        of comes within the territory. So we made a plan to list all the job
        that need to be done before the activity and let each one choose the job
        they want to do then work together to arrange the activity to suit
        everybody’s needs, including children and their parents. That was
        actually a really good experience for me to work collaboratively with
        other teachers to achieve the same goal and a lot of communication and
        compromises happened in the process and it helped us build relationships
        with each other, with parents and young children too.
